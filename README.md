# LANScan
LANScan is a tool for detecting all devices on a network, without having to bother with extra information. Extra information you would get from something like Nmap.

# Backstory
I was attempting to check my local area network for a possible intrusion. While doing so, I realized that I didn't need a bunch of extra's, just one accurate way to detect all other devices, and find their vendors. Long story short, I ended up writing what would soon be LANScan.
